## This was to see if I could access the lib on the biocluster because python base not installed on the work laptop for RStudio Windows edition. I couldn't carryt he solution forward because of package hierarchy issues.
```{r}
# .libPaths()
# myPaths <- .libPaths()
# myPaths <- c(myPaths, "\\\\skyemci01-bicoe.efs.agr.gc.ca\\cfia-ottawa-fallowfield\\users\\girouxeml\\R\\x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library\\4.2.1") 
# add a new path
# myPaths <- c(myPaths[3], myPaths[1], myPaths[2]) # switch them
# .libPaths(myPaths) # reassign path

# This assignment is what ended up working in the end!!!:
# .libPaths("\\\\skyemci01-bicoe.efs.agr.gc.ca\\cfia-ottawa-fallowfield\\users\\girouxeml\\R\\x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library\\4.2.1")
```
Old - before adding lib path that is on the biocluster:
> myPaths
[1] "/skyemci01-bicoe.efs.agr.gc.ca/cfia-ottawa-fallowfield/users/girouxeml/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2.1"    
[2] "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.2/library"                                                                            
[3] "C:/Users/girouxeml/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2"     
    
    
To use the biolcuster path, myPaths needs to look like this:
[1] "\\\\skyemci01-bicoe.efs.agr.gc.ca/cfia-ottawa-fallowfield/users/girouxeml/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2.1"
[2] "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.2/library"
